# OSC-to-MIDI
A simple script to receive notes and gates messages over Open Sound Control (OSC) and send MIDI commands to external hardware.

## How to use it
This script was conceived to create MIDI commands from CV values generated in VCV Rack and sent over OSC, through the almighty cvOSCcv module. 

### Setup:
- Load cvOSCcv into VCV Rack
- Connect the CV output of your sequencer/note generator to the Value input of `/ch/1` as if it is a 1 oct/CV input and your gate to `/ch/2`.
- Launch your script with explicit niceness, in order to get decent timing: `nice -n -15 python3 path-to-script/osc-to-midi.py` 
- Click on `Config` button on cvOSCcv and then `Enable` the OSC client
